This repo was initially created to help a friend interning at a company automate a task. The task was to automate the process of searching for a finance article about a given stock within a certain time frame. I was given a ghastly structured spreadsheet that was being used as a trading log. After explaining why the current structuring of the data was flawed I was asked to clean and reformat the data.

Therefore, I set out to complete 2 main tasks in this project:

1) Clean and reformat the data into the standard table structure.
2) Build a bot to to retrieve the url of a finance article from the internet based on a given ticker name and date.

[redacted_log.xlsx](https://github.com/agarcia50S/SideProjects/blob/master/redacted_log.xlsx) is the redacted version of the trading log and [file_redaction.py](https://github.com/agarcia50S/SideProjects/blob/master/file_redaction.py) is the code used to redact it.
